Standalone tools
    They can be used inside Eclipse (they are Eclipse plug-ins and configured to use their
    required plug-ins) or outside after having been built.

Metamodels
    They are standards EMF models and can be used with any EMF compatible tool.

Editor
    The RiseClipse editor is based on the generic EMF editor wich some specific feature
    like direct navigation from the selected object to another which is linked. OCL files
    can be loaded and validation with them can be done with a direct access to the object
    failing to validate a given constraint.
    When RiseClipse is installed in an existing Eclipse instance using the update-site,
    the RiseClipse editor can be used to open files conforming to installed metamodels.
    When RiseClipse project are available in a workspace, a new Eclipse instance can be
    launched to get the same behavior.

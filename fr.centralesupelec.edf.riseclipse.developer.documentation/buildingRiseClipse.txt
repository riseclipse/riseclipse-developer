Building with Maven
    The global pom.xml file is in fr.centralesupelec.edf.riseclipse.developer.maven.all
    
    The root pom.xml file (the one containing properties) is in
    fr.centralesupelec.edf.riseclipse.developer.maven
    
    To build standalone tools, eclipse dependencies must be installed using the command
      mvn eclipse:to-maven -DstripQualifier=true
    on a computer with Eclipse installed
    and answering (replace ~ with the path where the eclipse p2 directory is located)
      ~/.p2/pool
    to the question
      [INFO] Eclipse directory? 

    The ANTLR runtime 3.2.0 must also be installed by hand in the local .m2 repository
    using the provided org.antlr.runtime-3.2.0.zip (unzip it in ~/.m2/repository/ 
    replacing the 4.0.0 version).

Building with Eclipse
    The Eclipse plugins can be built using Export -> Plug-in Development
                                                  -> Deployable plug-ins and fragments
    
    To build standalone tools, plugins must be deployed in a new Eclipse project, then
    each standalone tool must have its Java Build Path configured to use the needed
    deployed plugins (jar files). After the creation of a Launch Configuration specifying
    the main class, a standalone tool may be built by exporting it as a "Runnable JAR file
    with option "Package required librairies into generated JAR".

Versions of needed components
    Usually, RiseClipse tools are built using the latest available needed components.
    However, they can be built with older components. With Maven, the used versions
    can be modified in fr.centralesupelec.edf.riseclipse.developer.maven/pom.xml
